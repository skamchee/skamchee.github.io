C is call by value. Passing a variable into a called function actually passes a copy, so the called function cannot alter the variable in the calling function.
However, you can edit the variable by passing in a pointer (a reference) to the variable. This means a copy of the pointer is passed to the called function. The called function can follow the pointer to edit the underlying value.

Compilation involves four stages:

1. Preprocessing
	#define HEIGHT 20

2. Compilation proper/Assembly 
	gcc -c head.c (Does not link, produces a head.o object file)

4. Linking
	gcc -o head.o arm.o leg.o body.o
